              <strong class="question">Why?</strong>
              Because I was somewhat dissatisfied with how Carolina's Café Colombiane turned out, I wanted to build
              another mobile game, but do it my way. I had an idea for a game where you play as a doggo sleuth who
              uncovers secret messages by good tapping. I also wanted to include a musical component.
            </p>
            <p class="answer">
              <strong class="question">How?</strong>
              After taking a few days to plan, I built the first twelve levels in one day each. This forced me to
              introduce new gameplay elements gradually, establishing a nice steady pace for the gameplay. Every time I
              created a new level, I copied and pasted the previous level and then added a new feature. This way, each
              new level feels similar to but slightly different from the previous. The game is built almost entirely of
              UI buttons and audio that I recorded using my voice.

              <strong class="question">Why?</strong>
              As a child, I often dreamed of falling from a high place.
              The moment I reached the ground, I woke up, my head hitting the pillow forcefully.
              The sensation reminds me of the story of Lucifer being cast out of heaven.
              I wrote an
              <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/13sce2jEWFdr9Gt1SskGnmAI_GmUf_NViNB39hJJOFGU">unfinished
                poem</a>
              to capture that feeling, from which I drew inspiration for the game.
              This was my final project for
              <a href="https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/week-4-personal-project-aug-3-aug-7">Create with Code</a>.
              I was in a dark place after getting laid off at the start of the pandemic and I felt trapped.
              I channeled these feelings into the game mechanics.

            <p class="answer">
              <strong class="question">How?</strong>
              At the start, you fall from a great height into a deep well. Hitting one of the four walls changes the
              player object to align with and move along the new wall, creating a 2D effect in a 3D game. Since the
              player object is a sphere, I had to build a function to prevent the player from drifting outside the
              playable area. The player's eye shines a light toward the nearest objective. In 2024, I released GOD MODE.
              Unlocked after completing the game, this mode gives the player infinite stamina.

              Built for the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/con-latinidad-2023">Con Latinidad</a> game jam. I wanted to
              make a game that honors my wife Carolina's Colombian heritage while telling stories inspired by her family
              and sharing the joy of Colombian cuisine.

              I had a game concept in mind from the beginning of this game jam, so I decided to take the lead on game
              design. In addition to game design and project management, I edited all of the game's text for spelling
              and grammar and partially translated the text into Spanish. I also fully tested the game, built and
              published the game, and assisted with code and production.

              theme of Roles Reversed. This was my third time participating in the annual event, but it was the first

              <strong class="question">How?</strong>
              Applying lessons learned from my first two GMTK jams, I found a team early and organized an 8-hour
              practice jam two weeks before the event started. This strategy helped us work through some technical
              issues and perfect our team dynamic, to produce a fun game within the time limit. I was responsible for
              code, testing, and project management. The whole team worked together nicely to invent and develop the
              concept. I'm proud of what we accomplished!

              My friend Tracey built a game. It was full of typos. Rather than complain, I decided to fix them myself.
              Once I got into it, I couldn't help but add some content of my own.

              plugging in one of the misspelled words to discover where it existed in the code. Although I was
              unfamiliar with LUA, I was able to reverse-engineer the code structure sufficiently to modify the game
              text. I looked through each of the game files, correcting typos as I found them, and contributing some
              small additions.

              I wanted to make something dead simple a la Flappy Bird.

            <p class="answer">
              <strong class="question">How?</strong>
              In the spirit of keeping it simple, I limited the controls to a single input. The player can tap anywhere
              or press the spacebar to fart, increasing the chicken's speed and propelling it upward toward the deadly
              spikes. The player must fart to avoid obstacles. I spent a good chunk of time fine-tuning the fart noises
              and particle effects and I'm quite pleased with the results. I think this one is hilarious. It also
              happens to be my first mobile-friendly game.
